#  Sales Data Analysis Dashboard (Excel Project)

An end-to-end Excel data analysis and visualization project that explores sales performance, profitability, and customer insights from 2014–2017.  
This project demonstrates my ability to clean, analyze, and visualize business data — transforming it into a clear and interactive dashboard that supports real-world decision-making.

## 🌟 Project Overview

This was my **first Excel-based data analytics project**, created while learning data visualization through Online tutorial and enhancing it with my own analytical approach and formatting.

The aim was to:
- Analyze company-wide sales and profit data  
- Identify business problems and opportunities  
- Design a clean, interactive Excel dashboard for management review  

The final deliverable includes a well-structured dataset, pivot-based analytics, and an **interactive dashboard** highlighting top-performing products, categories, and regions.

## 💼 Business Problems Identified & Solved

| Business Problem | Analytical Approach | Insight / Outcome |
|------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| 1️⃣ Which product categories are driving or reducing profit? | Compared Sales vs Profit using Pivot Charts | Identified low-margin sub-categories to optimize pricing |
| 2️⃣ Which regions or states contribute most to revenue? | Created state-wise sales & profit visualization | Pinpointed top and underperforming regions |
| 3️⃣ Who are the most valuable customers? | Filtered top 5 customers by sales contribution | Revealed top clients to target for retention programs |
| 4️⃣ How do sales trends change across months and years? | Built monthly/yearly trend analysis | Detected seasonal peaks and slow months |

✅ **How this helps the business:**  
The dashboard answers key management questions such as:
- *Where should we focus our marketing and inventory efforts?*  
- *Which products should be discontinued or repriced?*  
- *How to increase profit margins while maintaining strong sales?*
